# DnD Simulator

This is a hobby project of mine, where I want the user to be able to presentate his DnD sessions, battles, etc.

## Features

- You can host the game, then you'll be the Dungeon Master, where you can edit, move entities, place walls and doors. If you join as a client, you only see the player's perspective. You can't modify anything, you are just a spectator.
- Modify walls and doors
- Move entitites
- Fog of war
- Initiative tracker

## Planed features

- Scene manager
- Map builder
- More userfriendly options (turn off fog of war, more options for the DM and the user, etc.)


## Used technologies

- Unity engine
- Unity's Netcode for GameObjects multiplayer solution
